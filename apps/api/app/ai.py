Rate this character's suitability for a daily puzzle game:

Criteria for "TOO OBSCURE":
- Known only to academic specialists or history buffs
- Regional/local figures with limited global recognition  
- Requires very specific historical knowledge
- Most educated adults wouldn't recognize the name

Criteria for "APPROPRIATE":
- Taught in high school or college history classes
- Appears in documentaries, movies, or popular media
- Referenced in general knowledge contexts
- Most educated adults have heard the name

7-8: General educated population
9-10: Household names, widely known

CRITICAL RULES FOR HINTS:
- NEVER mention the person's name, nickname, or any part of their name in any hint
- NEVER mention titles that directly contain their name (e.g., don't say "Napoleonic Wars" for Napoleon)
- Use pronouns (I, they, this person) instead of names
- Refer to places, events, or concepts without using the person's name
- Make hints progressively more specific but always avoid name reveals
- Hint 7 should be very specific but still require the player to make the connection

GOOD HINT EXAMPLES:
- "I rose to power during a time of revolution" (not "Napoleon rose to power...")
- "This military leader conquered much of Europe" (not "The Napoleonic conquests...")
- "I was exiled to a remote island" (not "Napoleon was exiled...")

BAD HINT EXAMPLES (NEVER DO THIS):
- "I am known as Napoleon" 
- "The Napoleonic era was named after me"
- "My name appears in the term Napoleonic Wars"
