Generate a historical figure that meets these criteria:
- Well-known enough that players have a reasonable chance of guessing
- Historically significant (not just famous for being famous)
- Has interesting, distinctive facts for hints
- Can be from any time period or culture

Return your response as valid JSON with this exact structure:
{
  "answer": "Full Name",
  "aliases": ["Alternative Name 1", "Nickname", "Title"],
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1: Very broad historical context",
    "Hint 2: Time period or geographical region", 
    "Hint 3: Field of expertise or major role",
    "Hint 4: Specific major accomplishment",
    "Hint 5: More specific detail or turning point",
    "Hint 6: Very specific fact or famous quote/event",
    "Hint 7: Nearly gives it away but requires connecting the dots"
  ],
  "source_urls": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Name"]
}

CRITICAL RULES FOR HINTS:
- NEVER mention the person's name, nickname, or any part of their name in any hint
- NEVER mention titles that directly contain their name (e.g., don't say "Napoleonic Wars" for Napoleon)
- Use pronouns (I, they, this person) instead of names
- Refer to places, events, or concepts without using the person's name
- Make hints progressively more specific but always avoid name reveals
- Hint 7 should be very specific but still require the player to make the connection

GOOD HINT EXAMPLES:
- "I rose to power during a time of revolution" (not "Napoleon rose to power...")
- "This military leader conquered much of Europe" (not "The Napoleonic conquests...")
- "I was exiled to a remote island" (not "Napoleon was exiled...")

BAD HINT EXAMPLES (NEVER DO THIS):
- "I am known as Napoleon" 
- "The Napoleonic era was named after me"
- "My name appears in the term Napoleonic Wars"
